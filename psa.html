<p style="padding-bottom:100px; text-align:center;">For this project, I was tasked to create an audio-only PSA that's entire purpose is to highlight a sad situation within our world and asking for others to take apart of ending this situation via donations to an organization. This situation in particular is homelessness, and I chose the National Alliance to End Homelessness as my organization to make a PSA about. I utilized Audacity, which is a no-frills program that was quite troublesome to use at first. I was still able to produce a PSA with a fade in an fade out, and I was able to properly mix the audio to ensure that the music was not overpowering my voice and vice versa. I finished the project with the PSA above!</p>
