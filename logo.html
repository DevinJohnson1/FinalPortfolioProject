<p style="padding-bottom:100px; text-align:center;">For this project, I was tasked to create a animated logo for a company named "The Merry Go-Town", a daycare that is trying to advertise themselves to parents of children. I thought it would be best to create this logo via Adobe's Animate, as it would provide the proper environment to create this animation in. I settled for a moving white rectangle to be in front of a green smile, in which the white rectangle for 30 frames would move to the right. This would make it seem like the smile is appearing from nothing in time with the text floating on the screen. Animate's keyframes, as in most animation programs, allowed me to fully sync up the text on screen with the smile so that it would complete at the same time, with the end product above.</p>
