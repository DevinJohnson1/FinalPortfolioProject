<p style="padding-bottom:100px; text-align:center;">For this project, I was tasked to create a photo containing an original character utilizing Adobe's Illustrator tool, which required a deep amount of thought. The character I came down to was the "Treasure Hunting White Sparrow", as it was a rare creature that would be somewhat easy to create but still a challenge for me to overcome. I was able to use the tools in Illustrator effectively, such as the Shape Builder tool to create more complex shapes such as the hat. I then got some text to highlight who the bird was, while also getting a background of an oasis to finally create my own original character!</p>
