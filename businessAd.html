<img src="media/Photoshop Ad.png" alt="Guy looking a computer screen creating a 3D model" width="50%" height="50%" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
<p style="padding-bottom:100px; text-align:center;">For this project, I was tasked to create a photo ad for the company "3D World" in which I would have to edit myself into the provided image alongside creating a logo and text to match the ad. The main target for the ad was 3D modelers, as the company is all about outsourcing professional 3D modelers to different game design companies. I utilized Adobe's Photoshop in order for me to create this ad, as its masking features would prove vital to creating the following ad. Masking allowed me to create the oval shape for the logo, and also add myself into the image, to the point where others thought it was nearly seamless. Other than that, I put in some simple text for the ad with the background image, and my final product is what you see now!</p>
