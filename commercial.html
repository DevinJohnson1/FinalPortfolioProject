<p style="padding-bottom:100px; text-align:center;">For this project, I was tasked to create a PSA for an organization of my choice, making sure to add transitions between each image or video utilized. I wanted to do a PSA for the Save the Manatee organization, in where I would utilize images only from their website to offer others to join the organization. I utilized Adobe's Premiere Pro to create the PSA, a program I have a little experience with using before. I was able to easily place my images within the video, while utilizing the transition effects that are provided by Adobe. The final product is the near minute long ad above, so take a look and hopefully you will enjoy it!</p>
